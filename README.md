# FFR_Project
This website is not complete and I will still be working on the details as well as the pages linked to the index.html beyond this course.

Foster care is not something I thought I would be interested in... at all. I am not a "kid person" and the thought of returning a child to a potentially unsafe home boggles my mind. That was before my cousin and his girlfriend needed someone to care for their 9-month old son. My sister jumped at the chance and, almost a year later, he is still doing a kinship foster of that precious boy. Seeing my sister, a medical social worker, struggle to find out what to do and how, prompted me to choose foster family resurces as my capstone projet subject. 

The features I chose for this website are as follows:
1. Use a regular expression to validate user input and either prevent the invalid input or inform the user about it (in all cases prevent invalid input from being stored or saved). Users wishing to sign up for website updates will need to enter a valid email address.
2. Visualize data in a user friendly way. (e.g. graph, chart, etc). A pie chart shwing the amount of children in the different divisons of foster care in the United States.
3. Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app. This feature appears at the top  the page under the logo and in the console.

Media Query changes the background to white for viewing on mobile devices. Used Mobile View on VS Code (iPhone 8) with the following as the URL server http://127.0.0.1:5500/ to test.
